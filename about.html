      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Peninsula Pipeworks was founded 10 years ago by two passionate and skilled plumbers who shared a vision of providing reliable, high-quality plumbing services to the Cape Town community. With a commitment to excellence and a customer-first
        approach, we have grown from a small startup into one of the most trusted names in the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past decade, we've built a reputation for delivering consistent, top-notch service. Our hands-on experience, coupled with our deep understanding of the local plumbing landscape, has enabled us to tackle a wide range of challenges
        with precision and efficiency. Whether itâ€™s a simple repair or a complex installation, our focus remains on providing solutions that stand the test of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Peninsula Pipeworks, we take pride in being a locally owned and operated business. We believe in building lasting relationships with our clients, based on trust, transparency, and exceptional workmanship. As we look to the future, we
        remain dedicated to upholding the standards that have made us a preferred choice for plumbing services in Cape Town.
